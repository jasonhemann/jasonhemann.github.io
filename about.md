## Biography

Jason Hemann is a lecturer in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences
at Northeastern University. Hemann’s research interests include
functional and logic programming. He focuses on embeddings and
extensions to support logic programming in numerous host languages and
transforming functional programs to relational ones. His microKanren
model has inspired scores of implementations – more than 120, in over
40 host languages, in just five years. Jason’s other interests concern
novel uses of logic programming and symbolic constraint systems and
typesafe embeddings of logic languages.

Jason’s research interests blend together with his teaching. His
research questions tend to emerge from his teaching, and his results
make it back into the classroom. An example of this approach can be
found in his recently published textbook “The Reasoned Schemer, 2nd
Edition”. He has been teaching in various capacities for over 15
years, including pre-college STEM programs, private professional
training programs, and university courses at undergraduate and
graduate levels. His awards include “Associate Instructor of the Year”
at Indiana University.

Prior to joining Northeastern, Jason was briefly a visiting faculty at
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Jason earned his Ph.D. in 2020
from the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana
University as part of the programming language research community and
under the supervision of Dan Friedman. He earned his master’s in
computer science from the School of Informatics and Computing at
Indiana University, and both of his bachelor’s in computer science and
philosophy and a bachelor of arts in history at Trinity University in
San Antonio, Texas.
