## Biography


Jason Hemann is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Seton Hall
University. Hemann’s research interests include functional and logic
programming DSLs. He focuses on embeddings and extensions to support
logic programming in numerous host languages, transforming functional
programs to relational ones, and teaching languages to support DSL
programming. His microKanren model has inspired scores of
implementations – more than 150, in over 50 host languages. Jason’s
other interests concern novel uses of logic programming and symbolic
constraint systems and typesafe embeddings of logic languages.

Jason’s research interests blend together with his teaching. His
research questions tend to emerge from his teaching, and his results
make it back into the classroom. An example of this approach can be
found in his recently published textbook “The Reasoned Schemer, 2nd
Edition”. He has been teaching in various capacities for over 15
years, including pre-college STEM programs, private professional
training programs, and university courses at undergraduate and
graduate levels. His awards include “Associate Instructor of the Year”
at Indiana University.

Prior to joining SHU, Jason held Teaching Professor and Lecturer
positions at Northeastern University and the Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology. Jason earned his Ph.D. in 2020 from the School of
Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University as part
of the programming language research community and under the
supervision of Dan Friedman. He earned his master’s in computer
science from the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana
University, and both of his bachelor’s in computer science and
philosophy and a bachelor of arts in history at Trinity University in
San Antonio, Texas.
