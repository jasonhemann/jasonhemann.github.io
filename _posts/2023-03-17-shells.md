title: Is your shell what you think?
---

Depending how you installed a new version of `bash` on your mac, it
might surprise you to learn which version of bash you're using. For
instance, if ask for the version of bash at the prompt. Here's a
reasonable example. 


```bash
$ bash --version 
GNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (aarch64-apple-darwin21.6.0)
```

Looks good. If, however, we then go and check the BASH_VERSION ...

```bash
$ echo $BASH_VERSION
3.2.57(1)-release
```

We get a very different and worse number. What gives? Well, your login
shell is using a different version of bash than is currently front on
your path.

[This SO thread](login-shell) helpfully describes the problem and the
issue. If you are using the new version of homebrew, then you might
have had to move where you keep the programs brew installs: the new
location is `/opt/homebrew/bin`. If that's the one you want to set as
your login shell, then you'll have to first add it to the
`/etc/shells` file, and then use the following to set it.

```
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
sudo chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/bash
```

(If you failed to add that to your `/etc/shells` file, then `chsh` will
squawk that this is a non-standard shell.)

But after this, you should be good to go with an up-to-date login shell.
